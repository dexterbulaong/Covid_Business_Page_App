# Covid Coders

# For Report 3, I have sent pictures in a folder that showcases our code and will be showing you our code in the meeting/GitHub. The pictures show the following:

Capture 1 and Capture 2 showcases that we do in fact have files. It does not go into much detail about the files themselves but will showcase them to you at the meeting

Capture 3 Showcases our home page. From here we will be allowing users to choose where they want to go to on the app

Capture 4 Showcases our Categories page. This page allows us the user to choose which type of store/facility they want to look for. Each of the 8 choices does go to its own page which will have the database list (I did not take a pic of this cause it is empty as of now since the database is not connected yet)

Capture 5 Showcases our login page. This will allow the user to login to an account they made on the app and change their store/facility location. This also takes the user back to the home page once the user is done doing what he needed
