# Covid Business App 

The app is no longer able to make calls to the database web server since the 000webhost server that it was deployed to is no longer available. This repo is to document the work of the original project. This project was imported from gitlab.

## Description

This app was conceptually intended for use by businesses during the initial covid pandemic timeframe. The app made it so businesses could create a page in which they could post important covid related information about their business. This information included changes in business hours, mask requirments, contactless delivery, etc.

The app uses a custom Rest API built using the Slim Framework. The API was deployed to a free web server from 000webhost. The app utilizes a MySQL database that was exported to the same web server.
